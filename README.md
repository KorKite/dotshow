# imgdot
    It is made for linux server to show image.
    When we want to see image on python  linux server, 
    we have to save image or use jupyter notebook.

    To see thumnail of the image, we can use cv2.imshow in local environment.
    However, it is impossible for server ssh terminal.
    It is simple thumnail printer using python.
